The use of the phrases `ego` and `alter` in social sciences drives me crazy.

It's so pretentious.  What's wrong with `self` and `other`?  The RDMS idiom `me` and `foreign` would also work.
Really, anything that has more widespread and analogous use would lower the barrier to comprehension.

I'm hardly excusing the word choice in the natural sciences.  Biology is awful with its latination.
Physics regularly uses normal words is deceptively complex ways (e.g., the quark names), but I suspect that's
just Math envy.
